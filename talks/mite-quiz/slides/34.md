4 . When the pioneering Scottish photographer John Thomson set out in
1871, it took him two days just to travel the 70 
kilometers to this structure from the closest major
Asian city — with eight mules to carry his camera equipment. He had to
process his photos immediately on glass negatives in a tent that served as a mobile
darkroom. The images captured by Thomson and other early photographers caused a sensation
among those Westerners who saw them. “It was like us going to a lecture and seeing
photos of Mars or Venus” quoted an observer. It was known by a name meaning ‘the ten
thousand -unit-long’ in
the local language, the unit in question being equal to about half a
kilometer. What did John
Thomson photograph?
