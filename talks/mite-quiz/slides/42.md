2 . Legend is that X was first created in the kitchens of the
Mysore Palace by a palace cook named Kakasura Madappa out of the above
ingredients. The cook at the Mysore Palace kitchen simply made a
concoction of besan, ghee and sugar. The sweet that was formed delighted
the royalties so much that it became a "Royal Sweet". When asked its
name, Madappa obviously didn't have its name, so he simply called it the
‘X’, a delicacy from the Mysore Palace. The king relished the
sweet so much that he got Madappa to set up shop outside the palace
grounds so that it could be made available to common people.
