5 .  After Charles Darwin proposed the theory of evolution, a number of scientists calculated the age of the earth using Fourierâ€™s theory of heat conduction. Lord Kelvin
came up with an age between and 400 million years, Helmholtz calculated it to be 22 million years. This gave ammunition to critics of evolution, even 400 million years not being enough for evolution by natural selection. The age of the earth is now estimated to be atleast 4.5 billion years. What physical phenomenon not known in 1862, caused the miscalculation?.
