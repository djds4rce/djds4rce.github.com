The css for the shell was borrowed and modified from a similar
implementation by Devadutta(http://devadutta.net) released under GNU
GPL V3.
I initially wrote the JS in Jquery and finally moved it to Angular,
which is realesed under GNU GPL V3.
The fonts are used from dafont.com, their respective licences apply.
